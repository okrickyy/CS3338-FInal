\section{Backend Overview}

The backend is a standalone web service that provides all server-side
functionality for the game developed in the Unity engine (version 6.3).
Unity serves only as the client and communicates with the backend through
RESTful HTTP APIs using JSON.

The backend is responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item User authentication and account management.
    \item Player profile data (XP, level, statistics).
    \item Submitting and storing game session results.
    \item Generating and returning leaderboard data.
    \item Managing optional features such as an item store or inventory.
    \item Ensuring persistent data storage and secure server-side validation.
\end{itemize}

Unity does not perform any backend logic; it only sends requests and displays
responses. All core logic and data handling occur within the backend service.
